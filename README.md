-There is a lot to fix here, and I'm a little embarrassed. All of my JS was mostly wrong, and not long enough. 
-Added actual events and didn't just throw caution to the wind. I'm not really sure if I need to list much, you'd just have to see all of my answers and the new code to realize "Wow, she needed improvements." So I can try and show my errors and then my fixes. 
-Todo-domain had the right idea of me rendering todos with the document.getElementById, I just used it wrong by not giving it a name prior. 
-The function also had to be improved, and improved just means not established at all. 
-todo-ui had the math functions correctly of the less than and equal to, along with the messages, I just didn't do the right steps to add the event listener or anything onto the code. 
-I didn't need to use node.addEventListener, I just needed to use the right name. I also needed a lot more events. It's safe to say I did not know how to do all of these and should work on improving myself.
